1. In vscode, Ctrl+Shift+P
2. Type "WPILib Simulate Robot Code"
3. Check Sim GUI.  Click on OK
4. A window titled "Robot Simulation" should appear.  
	a. In this window, open the 2D field: Network Tables -> SmartDashboard -> Field.  You should only need to do this the first time.  
	b. You can then load an image that matches this years competition from https://github.com/wpilibsuite/PathWeaver/blob/main/src/main/resources/edu/wpi/first/pathweaver/2022-field.png.  Click on the "Download" button.  Then right mouse on it and click on "Save as..." and save it to your computer.  
	c. In the "Robot Simulation" window, right click on the title of the Field widget, then click on Field to open the Field menu, then click on "Choose image..", then navigate to where you saved "2020-field.png" and open it.
5. To start the motion of the sim robot, we need to be in autonomous mode.  In the "Robot Simulation", click on "Autonomous" in the "Robot State" widget.  You should see the green triangle move in the Field widget.
6.  To end the simulation, click on the orange square button at the top of vscode.
